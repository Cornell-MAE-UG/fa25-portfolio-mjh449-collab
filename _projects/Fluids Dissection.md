For my Fluid Mechanics class we were asked to dissect a Rocking Piston Air Compressor, and analyze it through the framework of the course material. My groups video illustrates the way the system functions, describing all aspects from the fluid container boundary movement (pistons) to actual meassured flow rate and power.
